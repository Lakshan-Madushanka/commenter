# Upgrade Guide

> [!important]
> This guide outlines the steps to upgrade the package to the next major version, which includes breaking changes.
> Please follow the instructions carefully to avoid any critical issues during the process.

## v1 to v2 [‚ö†Ô∏èBreaking Changes‚ö†Ô∏è]

This version marks a significant leap from v1, introducing many useful features. However, it also includes notable
breaking changes.

The primary change lies in the migrations. This version creates a new migration for the `guests` table and removes the
guest-related columns (`guest_name`, `guest_email`, `ip_address`) from the `comments` table and `user_id` removed from
`reactions` and added owner morph column (`owner_id`, `owner_type`) instead. While manually migrating data can
be cumbersome, there's no need to go through that hassle. An upgrade command has been introduced in the latest v1
release. Simply follow the steps below to complete the upgrade.

### Step 1 : Upgrade v1

Update the package to its latest v1 release or at least version 1.5.*.
```bash
composer update lakm/laravel-comments:^1.5
```

### Step 3 : Prepare v1

```bash 
php artisan commenter:upgrade
```

You will receive a success message, then proceed to sep 4.

### Step 4 : Upgrade to v2

Change the commenter version constraint in `composer.json`

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lakm/laravel-comments": "^2.0"
    }
}
```
Run following command

```bash
composer update lakm/laravel-comments:^2.0
```

### Step 4: Publish assets

> [!optional]
> Remove the previous assets by deleting `build` folder in `public/vendor/lakm/laravel-comments`
> path to free up space

```bash 
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=comments-assets --force
```

Enjoy the v2 ü§©.

## >= 2.0.5

This version fix the css style conflicting issue by adding a class prefix. So you must republish styles using
below command.

```bash 
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=comments-assets --force
```

## v2 to v3 [‚ö†Ô∏èBreaking Changes‚ö†Ô∏è]

> [!important]
> Upgrading to v3 may feel a bit cumbersome due to the major changes introduced in this release.
> However, we‚Äôve dedicated significant time and effort to ensure these updates improve the package for the long term.
> We apologize for any inconvenience üôè, but we truly believe these changes will greatly enhance the package‚Äôs functionality and maintainability.

v3 introduces significant changes to the package that will break the existing version if upgraded. 
Please carefully follow the guide below before upgrading.

### Database
Following tables have changed their structures.
- `comments` table
   - `reply_id` column has been removed ‚ùå.
   - `reply` morph column has been added ‚úÖ.
  ```php
        - $table->unsignedBigInteger('reply_id')->nullable()->index();
        + $table->nullableMorphs('reply');
  ```
***This adds an additional `reply_type` column, so you‚Äôll need to add that column and update the morph type of existing records in your comments table.***

> [!important]
> The class namespace has changed ([refer]). Therefore, you must update the morph types in your existing table records‚Äîunless you‚Äôre using morph maps.

### Namespace
The package namespace has been changed from `LakM\Commets` to `LakM\Commenter`. 

***You have to change your existing code to use the new namespace. specially in Commentable Model and
Commenter Model[refer](https://lakm.gitbook.io/commenter/basics/usage)***

```php

### Views

***So you have to use new directive namespace***

ex:
```php
<x-comments::index :model="$post" /> ‚ùå

```

- All the other publishable assets including Assets, Views are published to `vendor/lakm/commenter` directory.
